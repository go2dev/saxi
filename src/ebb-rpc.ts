/**
 * Message protocol between the main thread (ebb-proxy.ts) and the serial worker
 * (ebb-worker.ts). See PERF_PLAN.md workstream B.
 *
 * Granularity is one RPC per method call (one per motion during a plot), not
 * one per serial command: a motion's entire send->OK->send block stream runs
 * inside the worker, so postMessage latency never sits inside the serial cycle.
